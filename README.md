Moodify 
Listen to playlists based on your mood.

This project uses Microsoft's facial detection API and Spotify's API to analyze your mood based on the emotions you display in your picture and then selects four different playlists(from Spotify) for you to enjoy. 

This project is the initial prototype phase. Future development includes encoding more complex emotional analysis to create a more robust search for playlists as well as a 'save playlist' and sign in capabilities. 

Current development dependencies include the need for a new API key every hour for Spotify(easily accomplished) and a new API key for the facial detection software(more complex to accomplish). 

There is not npm package necessary to try this project.
